=== Market Data Streaming

To subscribe to a market data stream, unsubscribe from a previously-subscribed market data stream or retrieve the actual market data state (snapshot) 
a client shall send the *MarketDataRequest* message. 
Depending on *SubscriptionRequestType* value, the market simulator:

* creates a new subscription and starts requested market data streaming;
* cancels an existing subscription and stops market data streaming for cancelled subscription;
* responds with an actual state of requested market data in the form of a snapshot.

Each market data request can be associated with only one listing. 
Market data updates are sent for each visible market data change.

The format of a market data being streamed can be configured by a client in the *MDUpdateType* tag in the *MarketDataRequest* with 
*SubscriptionRequestType=Subscribe*, which allows to:

* stream the data in the form of incremental updates applied to the initially reported full state;
* stream the data in the form of full market data snapshots.

Active market data subscriptions are *automatically cancelled* by the simulator on client disconnection. 
The market data incremental streaming messages flow between the client application and the simulator: 

image::02MktDataStreamingMsg.png[width = 600, height=300]

The market data full snapshot streaming messages flow between the client application and the simulator:

image::01MktDataIncrementalMsg.png[width = 600, height=300] 

The market data snapshot request-response messages flow between the client application and the simulator:

image::03MktDataSnapReqRsp.png[width = 600, height=300]

The simulator can reject the Market Data Request message issued by a client due to different circumstances. 
In case session-level rules violation occurs, the Market Data Request message is rejected by the *Reject* message with the reject reason indicated in the *Text* tag. 
For application-level rules violation, the *MarketDataRequestReject* message is used to report the rejection to a client, with an optional *MDReqRejReason* and 
*Text* specifying the details:

image::04MktDataReqRct.png[width = 600, height=300]

The application-level reasons for a MarketDataReject message are listed in the table below with details:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]

|===
| Reason | Condition | MDReqRejReason (tag 281) value | Text (tag 58) value

| MarketDataRequest contains no securities inside NoRelatedSym (146) group | – | – | 

| MarketDataRequest contains more than one security inside NoRelatedSym (146) group | – | –  
| ‘market data requests on multiple securities are now allowed'

| No security matches listing identification attributes specified in NoRelatedSym (146) group | – |
Unknown Symbol (0) | ‘listing not found'

| Security identification attributes cannot in NoRelatedSym (146) cannot be used to identify the listing (see Instrument Resolution section) | – |
Unknown Symbol (0) | ‘listing identification attributes set is malformed’

=== Trading Messages

[[message-flows-trd-msg-new-odr]]
==== New Order Single

To create a new order a client shall issue the *NewOrderSingle* message, which should contain new order properties. 
The simulator responds with an *ExecutionReport* message indicating that an order for a requested listing is created and is ready to be executed. 
Each successfully created new order is acknowledged with an ExecutionReport containing *ExecType=New* and *OrdStatus=New*:

image::05MktDataNewOrderSgl.png[width = 600, height=300]

A NewOrderSingle message can be rejected by the simulator. 
An application-level reject is always issued in the form of an *ExecutionReport* message with *ExecType=Rejected*, *OrdStatus=Rejected*, 
and a *Text* field specifying the reason for a new order rejection:

image::06MktDataNewOrderRct.png[width = 600, height=300]

NewOrderSingle message rejection reasons are listed in the table below:

[cols="1,1,1"]

| Price (44) is specified in NewOrderSingle request | Reported when an order with OrdType=Market is specified with a price | ‘order price is not allowed’

| OrderQty (38) is missing in NewOrderSingle request | – | ‘order quantity missing’

| Value in Price (44) is not a multiple of the requested listing’s price tick | – | ‘order price tick constraint is violated’

| Value in OrderQty (38) is not a multiple of the requested listing’s quantity multiple | – | ‘order quantity multiple constraint is violated’

| Value in OrderQty (38) is less than the requested listing’s quantity minimum | – | ‘minimal order quantity constraint is violated’

| Value in OrderQty (38) is greater than the requested listing’s quantity maximum | – | ‘maximal order quantity constraint is violated’

| An opposite side has no orders matching the new order to be traded | Reported only for orders with

OrdType=Market or TimeInForce=ImmediateOrCancel or TimeInForce=FillOrKill | ‘no facing orders found’

| All matching opposite orders cannot fill a new FillOrKill order | Reported only for orders with TimeInForce=FillOrKill | 'not enough liquidity to fill FoK order'

* SecurityTradingStatus is “Trading halt” - 326=2 | – | ‘request cannot be processed during halted trading status’

|===
[[message-flows-trd-msg-exe-rpt]]
==== Execution Report

Once a NewOrderSingle message is accepted and acknowledged by the simulator, an order can be traded. 
Each trade event is reported by the *ExecutionReport* message with *ExecType=Trade*. 
The order status is changed to *OrdStatus=PartiallyFilled* if there is volume left for being executed, 
otherwise order status is changed to *OrdStatus=Filled* and the order is terminated. 
The diagram below illustrates the basic message flow for the order lifetime between a client and the simulator:

image::07MktDataExeRpt.png[width = 600, height=300]

The simulator cancels orders with *TimeInForce=ImmediateOrCancel* automatically if there is a non-executed order part left after the order matching and trading process. 
Such cancellation would be reported by *OrdStatus=Cancelled* in the last execution report for an order:

image::08MktDataCancel.png[width = 600, height=300]

The simulator automatically cancels expired orders with *TimeInForce=Day* and *TimeInForce=GoodTillDate*. 
The cancellation is reported to a client in the form of an ExecutionReport message with *ExecType=Cancelled* and *OrdStatus=Cancelled*:

image::09MktDataPartialCancel.png[width = 600, height=300]

[[message-flows-trd-msg-odr-cl-rep-req]]
==== Order Cancel Replace Request

A client may issue an *OrderCancelReplaceRequest* to modify his active order. 
A successful modification is reported by an ExecutionReport message with *ExecType=Replaced* and *OrdStatus=Replaced*, as shown in the diagram:

image::10MktDataOrderReplace.png[width = 600, height=300]

An OrderCancelReplaceRequest message can be rejected by the simulator. 
An application-level reject is always issued in the form of an *OrderCancelReject* message with *CxlRejResponseTo=OrderCancelReplaceRequest*, *OrdStatus=Rejected*, 
and a Text field specifying the reason for a modification rejection. 
An order is not modified if OrderCancelReplaceRequest is rejected.

image::11MktDataCancelReject.png[width = 600, height=300]

OrderCancelReplaceRequest message rejection reasons are listed in the table below:

[cols="1,1,1"]

[[message-flows-trd-msg-odr-cl-req]]
==== Order Cancel Request

A client may issue an *OrderCancelRequest* (35=F) to cancel his active order. 
A successful cancellation is reported by an ExecutionReport message with *ExecType=Cancelled* and *OrdStatus=Cancelled*, as shown in the diagram:

image::12MktDataCancelSuccess.png[width = 600, height=300]

An OrderCancelReplaceRequest message can be rejected by the simulator. 
An application-level reject is always issued in the form of an *OrderCancelReject* message with *CxlRejResponseTo=OrderCancelRequest*, *OrdStatus=Rejected*, and a *Text* field specifying the reason for a cancellation rejection. 
An order remains active if OrderCancelRequest is rejected.
 
image::13MktDataCancelReplaceReject.png[width = 600, height=300]

OrderCancelRequest message rejection reasons are listed in the table below:

[cols="1,1,1"]

|===
| Reason | Condition |  Text (tag 58) value

| No listing matches listing identification attributes specified in OrderCancelRequest | – | ‘listing not found'

| Listing identification attributes cannot be used to identify the listing (see Instrument Resolution section) | – | ‘listing identification attributes set is malformed’

| Given OrigClOrdID (41), ClOrdID (11), or OrderID (37) do not match any client order for a requested listing.
Side (54) does not match the original order side value.
Order is terminated (e.g. filled or cancelled) | – | ‘order not found’

a| The venue is in the Open halted phase and OrderCancelRequest is not allowed on this halted phase.

“Open halted phase” means that in the message SecurityStatus (35=f), the tags are:

* TradingSessionSubID is “(Continuous) Trading” - 625=3
* SecurityTradingStatus is “Trading halt” - 326=2
| – | ‘request cannot be processed during halted trading status'

[[message-flows-trd-phase]]
=== Trading Phase and Trading Status Reporting

The Market Simulator allows clients to retrieve trading phase and status updates for a specific security by issuing a *SecurityStatusRequest* message with 
the *SubscriptionRequestType=Subscribe*. 
The simulator creates a subscription for a client and starts updates streaming in the form of *SecurityStatus messages*, 
each defining a currently active trading phase and its status. 
The subscription is considered to be active until a client sends an unsubscribe request in the form of *SecurityStatusRequest* message with *SubscriptionRequestType=Unsubscribe*. 
A subscription is automatically cancelled upon client disconnect. 
The general trading phase/status reporting message flow is described in a diagram below:

image::14MktDataStsReport.png[width = 600, height=300]

A client may also issue a current trading phase/status information only, without the creation of a subscription and further updates streaming. 
In this case, a client shall send a *SecurityStatusRequest* message with *SubscriptionRequestType=Snapshot*. 
The simulator replies with the *SecurityStatus* message only, as shown in the diagram below: 

image::15MktDataStsSnapSht.png[width = 600, height=300]

A SecurityStatusRequest message can be rejected by the simulator. 
An application-level reject is always issued in the form of a *BusinessMessageReject* message with *BusinessRejectReason* and *Text* specifying reject details.

image::16MktDataStsReject.png[width = 600, height=300]

SecurityStatusRequest message application level reject reasons listed in a table below.

[cols="1,1,1,1"]

|===
| Reason | Condition | BusinessRejectReason (tag 380) value | Text (tag 58) value

| No listing matches listing identification attributes specified in NewOrderSingle | – | Unknown Security (2) | ‘listing not found'

| Listing identification attributes cannot be used to identify the listing (see Instrument Resolution section) | – | Unknown Security (2) 
| ‘listing identification attributes set is malformed’

| SecurityStatusRequest has SecurityStatusReqID (324) value used by another active subscription | SecurityStatusRequest is sent with SubscriptionRequestType=Subscribe 
| Other (0) | 'security status subscription request id is already in use'

| No active subscription associated with a given SecurityStatusReqID (324) exists | SecurityStatusRequest is sent with SubscriptionRequestType=Unsubscribe
| Unknown ID (1) | ‘no subscription found for the security status request id’
