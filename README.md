</div>

QuantReplay is an open-source market simulator suite that you can host yourself, creating order-driven venues, with a matching engine, and publishing of market data, to test your trading and execution applications and strategies.

* **Simulator**. QuantReplay replays stored market data, but also can generate randomized orders, which are published via a FIX feed. The orders from your application connect via a FIX gateway to the matching engine, which can be in both continuous and auction mode, for single and multi-listed instruments. It covers all asset classes which are Order-driven, e.g. Equities, FX, Derivatives, exchange-listed fixed income.
* **Choice of your data**. QuantReplay provides multiple mechanisms to create the data published back to your applications \- Replay from a file and Auto-generated by QuantReplay.
* **Low footprint**. QuantReplay runs as a single native process per simulated venue, with a shared database across each venue instance.
* **Easy deployment**. Runs in a dockerized container, easy to deploy to any environment.

## Features

* **Multiple Markets and Listings.** Configure separate concurrent markets and traded listings, using industry standard symbology, and custom trading rules to emulate distinct markets.
* **Matching Engine.** Standard price/time priority order book matching logic, with support for different order types and time in force. Subscribe to L2 market depth full refresh or incremental updates, specified depth levels, and L1 details such as Last Trades, OHLC, and more.
* **Market Phases.** Continuous trading and configurable market phases.
* **Random Order Generation.** Realistic pseudo random order activity at a configurable update rate and quantity and price range.
* **Historic Data Playback.** Playback of historic multi level market data from a database or CSV file.
* **Recovery Options.** Save and recover system state on demand.
* **API.** FIX API for trading functions and REST API for remote administration of settings and status.

These features can be used in different trading and execution scenarios.

## Roadmap

* **Additional Market Phases.** Support for Auction and Trade at Last market phases.
* **Multi-listed Instruments.** Synchronization of prices for random order generation across multiple listings of the same instrument.
* **Real-Time Data Playback.** In addition to playback of historic data recorded in a database or file, also the ability to take a real-time FIX feed of market data, and play it back through the simulator in a way it can be traded against.
* **High Availability Recovery.** Additional recovery option to run multiple simulator instances and seamlessly recover from application failures during long test runs.
* **Client Simulation Mode.** Simulator acting as a client, generating random orders to populate activity in a third party trading system able to receive orders through FIX.
* **Extreme Market Events.** Scheduling extreme events such as high volatility, large price swings, and increased market impact as part of random order generation.
* **Quote-Driven Market.** Publishing a stream of quotes to simulate asset classes supporting bilateral quote streams, such as Foreign Exchange price streaming and Request For Quote (RFQ) workflows, Fixed income RFQ, etc.
* **AI Driven Market Simulation**. Order generation via a Generative Adversarial Network (deep learning) to replace statistical or stochastic point processes approach. This allows them to mimic any markets in real time.
* **QuantReplay Cloud**: Deploy and use QuantReplay in the Quod Financial provided cloud.

## Deployment Options

### Quickstart

The simplest way to get started with QuantReplay is to run it in a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):
1. Create a directory.
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in that directory.
3. Copy the following example in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
networks:
   market-simulator-net:
      driver: bridge

services:
   XETRA:
      image: ghcr.io/quod-financial/deploy_marketsim:develop
      container_name: XETRA
      networks:
         - market-simulator-net
      ports:
         - "9050:9050" # Port to sent REST API requests
         - "9051:9051" # Port to sent FIX messages
      volumes:
         - ./:/market-simulator/quod/data/
      environment:
         - INSTANCE_ID=SIMULATOR
         - PREFIX=QUOD
      depends_on:
         liquibase:
            condition: service_completed_successfully

   database:
      image: ghcr.io/quod-financial/postgres_marketsim:v13.4-init
      container_name: market-simulator-database
      networks:
         - market-simulator-net
      ports:
         - 15432:5432
      environment:
         - POSTGRES_DB=simdb
         - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      healthcheck:
         test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready --user=postgres --dbname=simdb" ]
         retries: 2
         interval: 5s
         timeout: 10s

   liquibase:
      image: ghcr.io/quod-financial/liquibase:develop
      container_name: market-simulator-liquibase
      networks:
         - market-simulator-net
      depends_on:
         database:
            condition: service_healthy
```

4. Run the docker compose command to start the simulator:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
5. It will create a `cfg` directory with the following structure:
   - `market_simulator.xml` - main configuration file for QuantReplay;
   - `configSim.txt` - QuickFIX configuration file [QuickFIX documentation](https://quickfixengine.org/c/documentation/);
   - `default` - the directory with QuickFIX AppDataDictionary and TransportDataDictionary files of FIX 5.0 SP2 version.
6. The database already contains the demo data, which can be used to test the simulator:
   - XETRA venue;
   - instruments:
     - AMZ;
     - MSF;
     - NFC;
     - VODI;
     - VOW.
7. Now you can send [REST API requests](#rest-api-requests-examples) and [FIX messages](#fix-requests-and-quantreplay-replies-examples) to QuantReplay using:
   - localhost:9050 for REST API requests;
   - localhost:9051 for FIX messages.

## FIX requests and QuantReplay replies examples

The complete list of supported FIX messages, tags, and message flows can be found in [FIX Rules of Engagement](https://quod-financial.github.io/quantreplay/FIXRulesOfEngagement/FIXRulesOfEngagement.html).
