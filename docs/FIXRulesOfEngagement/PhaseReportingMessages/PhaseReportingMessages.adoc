== Phase Reporting Messages

Support subscriptions to phase changes reported per security using SecurityStatus workflows when the phase change happens.
The SecurityStatusRequest and SecurityStatus messages are both expected to be sent in the context of a specific indicated listing. 
Changes to phase occur across the entire venue. 
In any case, the phase will always be reported by listing. 
This means if a phase change happens across the venue, a separate SecurityStatus message is sent for every listing on that venue 
(but, of course, only for the client-subscribed listings).
If there are any application-layer problems handling the SecurityStatusRequest, the simulator responds with a BusinessMessageReject (35=j) message, 
indicating the rejection details in Text and BusinessRejectReason tags, and considers the request invalid and terminated.
